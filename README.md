# JenkinsLib
A Shared Library to reuse functions between Jenkins Pipeline scripts, specifically tailored to customized engines for multiple target platforms & (pre)compiled engines

Credit to https://github.com/DavidtKate/JenkinsSharedLib for providing the foundation upon which this is built.

## Groups system:
The Swarm and Discord scripts read from a JSON file containing groups.

### Format
The format for these groups look like this:
```
{
	"groups": [
		{
			"name": "<GROUPNAME>",
			"discordID": "<DISCORD_ID>",
			"swarmID": ["<SWARM_ID>", "<SWARM_ID>"],
			"type": "<GROUPTYPE>"
		}
	]
}
```

```<GROUPNAME>``` is the name of the group. This could be "PR", "David" or "GENERAL" for example.

```<DISCORD_ID>``` is the Discord ID of a "user", "role" or "channel" from the ```<GROUPTYPE>```.

```<SWARM_ID>``` is the Swarm ID of a user from the ```<GROUPTYPE>```.

```<GROUPTYPE>``` determines the type of the group. This can be "user", "role" or "channel".

### Example
Here is an example of a groups.json file:
```
{
	"groups": [
		{
			"name": "<ROLE_NAME>",
			"discordID": "<DISCORD_ROLE_ID>",
			"swarmID": ["<SWARM_ID_ONE>", "<SWARM_ID_TWO>"],
			"type": "role"
		},
		{
			"name": "<CHANNEL_NAME>",
			"discordID": "<DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID>",
			"swarmID": ["<SWARM_ID_ONE>", "<SWARM_ID_TWO>", "<SWARM_ID_THREE>"],
			"type": "channel"
		},
		{
			"name": "<USER_NAME>",
			"discordID": "<DISCORD_USER_ID>",
			"swarmID": ["<SWARM_ID>"],
			"type": "user"
		}
	]
}
```
